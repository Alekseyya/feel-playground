Feel Scala Playground REPL
Feel version 1.18
# Build and run
Use the REPL installation documentation https://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-REPL 
Sample scripts https://camunda.github.io/feel-scala/docs/playground/repl

# Windows
After installation go to the folder with amm. Execute the command .\amm.bat --predef feel-repl.sc --watch script.sc

# macOS
Execute in the console
$ brew install ammonite-repl

Where --predef feel-repl.sc predefines the file (similar to import)
--watch allows you to run script.sc every time it changes.
